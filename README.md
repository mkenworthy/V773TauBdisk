V773 Tau is a quintuple system consisting of two binary systems (called A and B) orbiting around each other, with a distant third companion, C, orbiting this combined system. A deep and extended eclipse discovered in KELT photometric data is consistent with the B binary being surrounded by a circumbinary disk (tilted with respect to the orbit of the A-B system) eclipsing the A binary. This paper presents the evidence for this interpretation along with new orbital solutions for all dynamical components in this interesting young stellar system.
